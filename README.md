Part 2 â€“ conduct and report a usability evaluation of an app of your choice. You must correctly use the Cooperative Evaluation method. (1000 words max)

Part 1 â€“ A summary of the history of HCI and its importance to contemporary computing (1000 words max).

You are expected to plan and write a 1000-word reportâ€¯that critically explores the history of HCI and its importance to a particular aspect of contemporary computing.

You will select a particular area of contemporary computing to focus your writing on. For example:

â–ª Platform Economies

â–ª Health technologies

â–ª Or something of your choosing

i. Introduce an element of contemporary computing and its relevance to HCI.

iii. Provide a brief history of HCI as a background to this aspect of computing and evaluate the impact of HCI on it now. iv. Conclude with a summary of this part of your report highlighting the key points and/or arguments set out.

The report should utilise external sources (e.g., grey literature, academic articles, news articles, reports, etc.) to develop analysis and make critical points about your chosen element of computing.

The report will be created for a general audience, avoiding jargon and technical language where possible, and will be expected to clearly demonstrate understanding and applications of key concepts of HCI as they relate to your chosen topic.

Format: Reports should use the template provided. Do not include your name anywhere on the document.

Submission details: Coursework is to be submitted as an MS Word doc (e.g. .docx) file, on NESS.

Word limit: for whole coursework is 2000 words, not including section or table headings in report template.

Marking Criteria: The following grade descriptor is used for marking part 1 of the coursework â€“ which is more essay like. The descriptions for each category are intended as a â€˜best fitâ€™. It is inevitable that responses will have characteristics of more than one of the descriptions, or that not all aspects of any one description are met, in which case academic judgement is used to assign a mark based on the overall quality of the work. Once a grade is selected it will then be divided by 50% to give a mark out of 50 for this component of the coursework.
